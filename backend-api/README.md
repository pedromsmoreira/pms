Pet Management System

## Repository structure

- backend-api -> will have the base api for the system to work

## Tech stack to explore

- jvm language preferably
- use the best framework at hand, but for now we can go with Spring Boot
- build tool can be Maven or Gradle (to be fair any can do the job it just needs to build and compile the application)
- databases can be cassandra, elastic, cockroachdb, etc. The best one to solve the problem
